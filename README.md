# qfilter

## Overview

Q-Filter is a Ruby-on-Rails application that builds a virtual network and incentive sturcture to encourage users to vote on posts as curators and then uses an aggregated metric to organize posts with the tag 'q-filter'

## Requirements and Setup

Since QFilter is a Rails application, you'll need to download Ruby and then run the bundler to get all of those useful gems. Here's a useful link for those needing to download Ruby. You'll want to get at least version 2.2 (although this application defaults to 2.3 in the Gemfile). 

[Ruby Installation Help](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

After you successfully have downloaded Ruby, you will need to install the bundler gem running this command:

`gem install bundler`

To finish everything off, simply run the bundler within the project and it will finish the setup for you by grabbing the rest of the gems:

`bundle install`
